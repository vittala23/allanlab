  image: Hthon.png
  description: This article articulates the needs for technologies, data, tools, and computational methods to model the multi-scale regulatory processes of biological systems in single-cell identified our three hackathon studies. It leverages these challenges to present a broad overview of the different types of analysis methods that can be currently applied to identify regulatory processes from multi-omics single-cell data sets and promising areas of future algorithmic development.

  image: pub3.gif
  description: Single-cell genomic technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity to define molecular cell types in a data-driven fashion, but present unique data integration challenges. Integration analyses often involve datasets with partially overlapping features, including both shared features that occur in all datasets and features exclusive to a single experiment. Previous computational integration approaches require that the input matrices share the same number of either genes or cells, and thus can use only shared features. To address this limitation, we derive a novel nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm for integrating single-cell datasets containing both shared and unshared features.

- title: "Intercellular interactions of an adipogenic CXCL12‐expressing stromal cell subset in murine bone marrow"
  image: pub4.gif
  description: Bone marrow houses a multifunctional stromal cell population expressing C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), termed CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells, that regulates osteogenesis and adipogenesis. The quiescent pre-adipocyte-like subset of CXCL12+ stromal cells (“Adipo-CAR” cells) is localized to sinusoidal surfaces and particularly enriched for hematopoiesis-supporting cytokines. However, detailed characteristics of these CXCL12+ pre-adipocyte-like stromal cells and how they contribute to marrow adipogenesis remain largely unknown. Here we highlight CXCL12-dependent physical coupling with hematopoietic cells as a potential mechanism regulating the adipogenic potential of CXCL12+ stromal cells.
